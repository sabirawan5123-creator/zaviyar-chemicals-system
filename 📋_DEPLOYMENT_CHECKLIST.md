## ❗ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: Can't push to GitHub**
- [ ] Check if Git is installed: `git --version`
- [ ] If not installed: Download from https://git-scm.com
- [ ] Restart PowerShell after installing

### **Problem: Build failed on Render**
- [ ] Go to Render Dashboard
- [ ] Click your service
- [ ] Click "Logs" tab
- [ ] Look for errors in red
- [ ] Fix the error in your code
- [ ] Push again: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix" && git push`

### **Problem: App shows error after deploy**
- [ ] Check Render Logs for errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Make sure `JWT_SECRET` is added

### **Problem: Slow loading**
- [ ] This is normal for free tier (cold start)
- [ ] First visit after 15 min inactivity = 30-60 sec
- [ ] After that = instant
- [ ] To fix: Upgrade to $7/month plan

### **Problem: Can't login**
- [ ] Check if using correct credentials
- [ ] Try default: admin / admin123
