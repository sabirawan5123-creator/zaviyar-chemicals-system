## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUE: Contact "Both" Type

### **Issue:**
When a contact is marked as BOTH (customer AND supplier), they may not appear in Sales or Purchase dropdowns due to browser caching.

### **Solution for Client:**

**When adding/editing contacts:**
1. After saving a contact, go to Sales/Purchase page
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` (hard refresh) to clear cache
3. Contact will now appear in the dropdown

**For developers/admins:**
The system has cache-busting built-in, but sometimes browsers are aggressive with caching. The database and backend are 100% correct.

---

## 💡 TRAINING FOR CLIENT

### **Basic Workflow:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Add products (Products module)
   - Add customers (Contacts - select Customer)
   - Add suppliers (Contacts - select Supplier)

2. **Daily Operations:**
   - **Sales:** Create invoice → Select customer → Add products → Save
   - **Purchase:** Create PO → Select supplier → Add products → Save
   - **Expenses:** Add expense → Select category → Enter amount

3. **Reports:**
   - Go to Reports module
   - Select report type
   - Choose date range
   - Click "Generate Report"
   - Export to CSV or Print

4. **Ledger:**
   - Go to Contacts → Click customer/supplier
   - Click "Ledger" button
   - View full transaction history
   - Download PDF or Print

---

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

1. **Change Default Password:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to Settings or Users
   - Change password immediately

2. **JWT Secret:**
   - In production, use a strong secret key
   - Never share the `JWT_SECRET` publicly

3. **HTTPS:**
   - Render.com automatically provides HTTPS
   - All data is encrypted in transit

4. **Database:**
   - SQLite file is on the server

---

## 📱 CLIENT ACCESS

### **After Hosting:**

**Share with Client:**
